# 0-1-Knapsack-Problem
Shown in the code snippets are my approach to solve the classical knapsack problem. It is also known as rucksack problem, 
0-1 knapsack problem among other names. The problem goes as follows:
Assume you are given weights and values of N items.Put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum 
total value in the knapsack. Note that we have only one quantity of each item.Simply it means, given two integer 
arrays val[0..N-1] and wt[0..N-1] which represent values and weights associated with N items respectively. Also given 
an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights 
of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it 
hence it is referred to as 0-1 Knapsack problem to distinguish it from other forms of the problem such as Fractional knapsack etc.


In order to solve this problem , I use dynamic programming using 2-Dimensional array. The time taken to solve this
problem is O(W*n).
