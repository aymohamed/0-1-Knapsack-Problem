    <h1>Star Citizen</h1>
    <h2>The Pinnacle of Escapism</h2>

    <p>Star Citizen is an open world space sim currently in development by Cloud Imperium Games. This fully crowdfunded game promises to let you go wherever you want, to be whoever you want. Travel to star sytems with multiple planets and space stations, leave your ship and explore them. The combination of space combat and FPS provides a unique and exciting gameplay experience. </p>

      <h2 class="sub">Walk your own path</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Enjoy the comforts of Citizenship, or embrace a life of crime.         </li>
        <li>Follow a civiliian career path like mining, trading, exploration or salvage.</li>
        <li>Experience the life of a Mercernary, Pirate, Smuggler or Bounty Hunter.</li>
        <li>Become a professional racer, or rise to the top ranks in Sataball. A fictional game based loosely on the zero-gravity training sequences from <span>Ender's Game</span> by Orson Scott Card.
    </ul>
    <h2 class="sub">Choose your weapon</h2>
          <ul>
              <li>Over 20 flyable ships from 10 different in-lore manufacturers, with more on the way.</li>
              <li>Use the right tool for the job, ballistics or lasers. Choose wisely.</li>
            <li>From handguns to railguns, protect yourself when on foot. Even an upstanding Citizen needs protection.</li>
            <li>Employ various explosives ranging from a simple hand grenade all the way up to anti-capital ship torpedoes.</li>
          </ul>
    <p class="sec">Star Citizen is currently in Alpha so the features are limited, but the studio has employed talented developers from all over the world to realize a dream: to make the <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/" target="_blank">Best Damn Space Sim Ever</a>. I believe they can achieve this goal and I truly hope they succeed.</p>
